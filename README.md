# Number-Expander
Displays a number expander to support learning about standard and non standard partitioning of numbers in maths
This project was initiated to supprt the teaching of numbers to primary school children, specifically to introduce and cement their knowledge of place values in numbers up to 7 digits. The application will ask the user to enter a number (up to 7 digits) and display the digits for each number alongside its place value description in word form as a number expander. When the user clicks on the word form, the solution will hide the word, which can be reintroduced via a reset button. The application will also show examples of standard and non standard partition for the number.
