# Ez-Pz Maths
This project contains multiple solutions to build maths skills in primary school children
Times Table (custom)
Adapted from a prize wheel solution, this application allows the user to define parameters for creating a times table wheel before a wheel of times tables is presented for the user to spin.

Custom Times Table wheel
Adapted from a project that displays prize wheel, this solution allows users to specify different times tables and their occurence to display in a prize wheel that can be spun.

Number Expander
Displays a number expander to support learning about standard and non standard partitioning of numbers in maths
Introduces and cements  knowledge of place values in numbers up to 7 digits. The application will ask the user to enter a number (up to 7 digits) and display the digits for each number alongside its place value description in word form as a number expander. When the user clicks on the word form, the solution will hide the word, which can be reintroduced via a reset button. The application will also show examples of standard and non standard partition for the number.
